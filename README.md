# NBA-Jam---C-Final-Project
A clone of the game 'NBA Jam' made for a final project in an introductory C++ class.

The game was used to demonstrate knowlege in control flow (if/else statements, for loops, while loops), basic data structures (arrays and vectors), and object oriented programming (utilizing multiple classes).

Please see the uploaded file "NBA Jam Final Write-Up" to review how this program works. The write-up was written as a part of the submission to the TA grading the project.
